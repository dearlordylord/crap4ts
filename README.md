# crap4ts

A Rust-based CRAP metric quality gate for TypeScript projects.

The intended pipeline is:

```text
CLI -> source selection -> coverage adapter -> TypeScript analysis
    -> exclusive coverage attribution -> CRAP scoring -> report and gate
```

The implementation is being specified from comparative research rather than
by selecting one existing port as a template. Version 1 consists of a Rust core
and standalone CLI, plus a thin npm wrapper that installs and invokes the
correct prebuilt binary for the user's platform.

## Alternative implementation research

Alternative research is deliberately dated. Later reviews add new entries
instead of silently rewriting the historical basis for an architectural
decision.

## Status

The implementation specification is tracked in
[issue #1](https://github.com/dearlordylord/crap4ts/issues/1).
